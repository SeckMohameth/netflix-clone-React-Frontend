# Netflix Clone Front-end

Recreated the Netflix site using React.js\
This was a great way to work on my react skills and learn new things. In the future I'm hoping to add authentication and improve upon existing functionality to the app.\
## Site is live!
[https://netflix-clone-302bd.web.app/](https://netflix-clone-302bd.web.app/)


- A new random banner image will appear everytime you refresh the page
- When you click on an image a trailer will play. This needs to be improved because no trailer is found or it plays the wrong one.
- Deployed using Firebase
- Using the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API
